    <h2>Name origin and rationale</h2>

    <p>Developers and project administrators typically do not employ a semantic system for
      naming directories, but more commonly use conventional placeholder
      names. The intended purpose of files in a directory with a placeholder
      name then must be inferred from experience or inspection of the files, or
      learned from documents or other people.</p>

    <p>For example, a directory named <code>exe/</code> probably derives its name from the
      fact that the contained files have their executable permission bit set;
      however, such a directory will not contain all such files.  There might
      even be some files in an <code>exe/</code> directory that do not have their
      executable permission bit set. The two concepts being an <code>exe/</code> file
      (i.e. being a file in an <code>exe/</code> directory) and being an executable file
      are not identical. The actual intended meaning of being an <code>exe/</code> file
      will sometimes be that the contained files are applications available to a
      user, or that they are tools available for use in a project.
    </p>

    <p>The directory names in this project resulted from an exploration of a
      property-based file system. In such a system a number of files and
      agents are defined. Then we can ask questions about their relationships.
      Files with a relationship to the developer are collected, and this
      becomes the <code>developer/</code> directory. In a similar manner we get the
      directories, <code>tester/</code>, and <code>javac/</code>.  In this latter case the
      agent is a compiler rather than a role.
      </p>
      
    <p>When attempting to apply the <code>is-for</code> property in practice it
      became apparent that using this sole property was insufficient.  Consider
      the directories <code>deprecated/</code> and <code>scratchpad/</code>. There is no
      <em>Mr. Deprecated</em> or <em>Mr. Scratchpad</em> who the contained
      files are for. (And this conclusion is not for the lack of trying. Even
      mythological beings did not suffice as agents.) Rather than being for an
      agent, the files collected in such a directory have in common a state of
      being that was imposed upon them by decree.  Perhaps the developer, has
      decreed that a file is now deprecated, or a build script has decreed that
      it is a scratchpad file. Such decrees are typically more dynamic than the
      relationship properties. Also, these properties are disconnected from the
      contents of the file.  When, for example, a file has the property of being
      for the java compiler, we gain some information about its contents. In the
      universe of possible messages sent through a file, such a file will
      contain text that is proposed to be java syntax conforming. In contrast,
      when we learn that a file is <code>deprecated/</code> we gain no
      information about the contents of the file, because any file can
      be <code>deprecated</code>, independent of its contents.
      </p>

    <p>To understand a directory name within this system, one can imagine
      reading said name as part of a sentence that integrates the
      property. Consider two property names: <code>is-a</code>
      and <code>is-for</code>. For example, "Each file in
      the <code>document/</code> directory <code>is-a</code> document," or "Each
      file in the <code>developer/</code> directory <code>is-for</code> the
      developer."  Although the property name is not carried over from the
      property based file system to the conventional file system, we can
      typically infer what it must have been. (It is beyond the scope of
      discussion here, but in actuality, property based file system collections
      are defined by predicates. Each predicate is given a file's properties and
      relationships as arguments, then resolves to true if and only if the file
      belongs to the collection. Now wouldn't that be interesting if we instead
      derived a probability?)
    </p>

    <p>It is uncommon for a property value to be plural. While it is not
      disallowed, it rarely occurs in practice. This is true independent of
      whether we are discussing a relationship property or a state
      property. Hence when we make a file collection based on a shared property,
      then carry that over as a directory name in a conventional file system,
      the resulting directory name will often be singular.  This pattern can be
      observed in the case of the <code>document/</code> directory, as shown in
      the prior paragraph.
